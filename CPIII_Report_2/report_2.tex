\begin{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(1) Simple LU decomposition}

    The goal here is to solve the system of equations~\eqref{equ_matrix_first} using a simple LU decomposition computed as shown in listing~\ref{MatLab/lu_decomposition}, which is used by default by the listing~\ref{MatLab/solve_ls}, where the system is rewritten as the matrix equation $A \vec{x}=\vec{b}$.

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{rcl}
         x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 + 4x_4 &=& 30 \\
        -x_1 + 2x_2 - 3x_3 + 4x_4 &=& 10 \\
                x_2 -  x_3 +  x_4 &=&  3 \\
         x_1 +  x_2 +  x_3 +  x_4 &=& 10
        \label{equ_matrix_first}
    \end{array}
    \end{equation}

    The solution vector is $x = (1 \, 2 \, 3 \, 4)$ , which coincides exactly with the solution obtained using Matlab’s matrix operations.

    \matlabscript{MatLab/lu_decomposition}{A script which does the LU decomposition with pivoting.}
    \matlabscript{MatLab/solve_ls}{A script that solves a matrix equation using different LU decomposition.}
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(2) Comparison between Matlab's implementation and ours}

    As it can be seen in figure~\ref{figs/error_matrix_2_c}, the difference between our matrix $L\&U$ and Matlab's ones increase with the matrix size, as expected. This difference is closed to the machine error, which is good. The difference between our computed matrix $L \cdot U$ and $P \cdot A$ is closed to the difference for the same matrix using Matlab's implementation, but as one can see in figure~\ref{figs/time_matrix_lu_c}, our algorithm use a way longer time for computation.
    
    \scalefig{figs/error_matrix_2_c}{0.8}{Difference between Matlab matrix $L \& U$ and our matrix $L \& U$, and between obtained matrix $L \cdot U$ and $P \cdot A$}
    \scalefig{figs/time_matrix_lu_c}{0.8}{Time used by the LU algorithm's for different matrix' size}
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(3) LU decomposition and pivoting}

    In order to properly study the impact of a pivot in the LU decomposition algorithm, a case study is made on the following matrix :
    \begin{equation*}
        M =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 0 \\
        2 & 4 & 8 \\
        3 & -1 & 2
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
    
    In this case, the algorithm was applied straight away on $M$ rather than on $P  \cdot  M$. The obtained result, shown in equation~\eqref{equ_result_inf}, has elements of value infinity or NaN (not a number). This is due to the potential division by zero within the algorithm. This phenomenon is a general problem which happens when applying the algorithm to any random square matrix, leading to nearly all tests from the script $test\_lu.m$ to fail.
    \begin{equation}
        L = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 &     0 \\
        2 & 1 &     0 \\
        3 & -\text{Inf} & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        \, \,\, \, \,
        \, \,\, \, \,
        U = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        1  &   2  &   0 \\
        0  &   0  &   8 \\
        0  & \text{NaN} &   \text{Inf}
        \end{pmatrix}
        \label{equ_result_inf}
    \end{equation}
    
    In order to avoid this from happening, it is necessary to introduce pivoting by implementing a permutation matrix within the algorithm, following the method presented in class. This code, which is displayed in listing~\ref{MatLab/lu_decomposition}, gives us the three matrices of equation~\eqref{equ_result_pivot}. In addition, its application to random matrices works (all tests from $test\_lu.m$ passed).
    \begin{equation}
        L = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 &     0 \\
        0.6667 & 1 &     0 \\
        0.3333 & 0.5 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        \, \,\, \, \,
        \, \,\, \, \,
        U = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        3  &   -1  &   2 \\
        0  &   4.6667  &   6.6667 \\
        0  & 0 &   -4
        \end{pmatrix}
        \, \,\, \, \,
        \, \,\, \, \,
        P = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0  & 0  &   1 \\
        0  & 1  &   0 \\
        1  & 0  &  0
        \end{pmatrix}
        \label{equ_result_pivot}
    \end{equation}
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(1) Wheatstone bridge's equations}
    
    In the exercise, the goal is to determine using the same method the currents in each branch of an electric circuit, considering Ohm’s law $U = RI$ and Kirchhoff’s current laws $\sum_{\text{node}} \vec{I} = \vec{0}$. Applied to the circuit in figure~\ref{figs/wheat} and taking $U_1 = V - V_A, U_2 = V - V_B, U_3 = V_A$ et $U_4 = V_B$, these give us 5 equations, 2 for the currents and 3 for the voltage as in equation~\eqref{equ_wheat_first}.
    \scalefig{figs/wheat}{0.3}{Wheatstone bridge}
    
    As we have 5 unknown current values (one per branch), we need to define a system of five linear equations (in order to have a square matrix $5\times5$).

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{rcl}
        I_1 &=& I + I_3 \\
        I + I_2 &=& I_4 \\
        R_1 I_1 + R I &=& R_2 I_2 \\
        R I + R_4 I_4 &=& R_3 I_3 \\
        R_1 I_1 + R_3 I_3 &=& V
        \label{equ_wheat_first}
    \end{array}
    \end{equation}
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(2) Solution for $I$}
    
    Putting equation~\eqref{equ_wheat_first} into matrix form and solving using Matlab gives us the equation~\eqref{equ_solve_I} for the unknown current $I$.
    \begin{equation}
        I = \frac{-V  (R1  R4 - R2  R3)}{R  R1  R2 + R  R1  R4 + R  R2  R3 + R1  R2  R3 + R  R3  R4 + R1  R2  R4 + R1  R3  R4 + R2  R3  R4}
        \label{equ_solve_I}
    \end{equation}
    This equation gives us the condition on equation~\eqref{equ_solve_I0} for $I=0$, which can be rewritten for a condition on $R_1$ as $R_1 = R_2 \cdot R_3 / R_4$. An other solution, logical, is having $R$ going to infinity.
    \begin{equation}
        R1 \cdot R4 = R2 \cdot R3
        \label{equ_solve_I0}
    \end{equation}
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(3) Solution for given resistances}
    
    Assuming $R_1 =20 \kilo\ohm,R_2 =40 \kilo\ohm,R_3 =15 \kilo\ohm,R_4 =30 \kilo\ohm,R=10 \kilo\ohm$ and $ V =10 \volt$, we solved the system of equation~\eqref{equ_wheat_first} with three different methods, Matlab's built-in LU function, and our to implementation (with and without pivoting). This give us the solution $S$ in equation~\eqref{equ_solved_wheat}. As one can see, our implementation without pivoting didn't work, as explained in the last part of the Problem~1. An other interesting fact was that, according to Matlab, there wasn't any difference between our implementation with pivoting and its implementation. It could be interesting to solve this problem again, but with seven equation and adding variable $V_A$ and $V_B$ into the problem, it could change the result obtained.
    
    \begin{equation}
        S_\text{Matlab} = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0.2857 \\ 0.1429 \\ 0.2857 \\ 0.1429 \\ 0
        \end{pmatrix}
        \, \,\, \, \,
        \, \,\, \, \,
        S_\text{without pivot} = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        \text{NaN} \\ \text{NaN} \\ \text{NaN} \\ \text{NaN} \\ \text{NaN}
        \end{pmatrix}
        \, \,\, \, \,
        \, \,\, \, \,
        S_\text{with pivot} = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0.2857 \\ 0.1429 \\ 0.2857 \\ 0.1429 \\ 0
        \end{pmatrix}
        \label{equ_solved_wheat}
    \end{equation}
\end{homeworkSection}

\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    
    The goal here is to find the stoechiometric coefficients of the following chemical reaction by rewritting equation~\eqref{equ_chemi} as a system of linear equations.
    \begin{equation}
        n_1 \text{[FeS]} + n_2 \text{[NaBiO$_3$]} + n_3 \text{[H$_2$SO$_4$]} \longrightarrow n_4 \text{[Bi$_2$(SO$_4)_3$]} +  n_5 \text{[Fe$_2$(SO$_4)_3$]} +  n_6 \text{[Na$_2$SO$_4$]} + n_7 \text{[H$_2$O]}
        \label{equ_chemi}
    \end{equation}
    
    The system is computed in matrix form $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ as in equation~\eqref{equ_chemi_matrix} where each line corresponds to an element of the chemical reaction (in order of appearance).
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & 0 & 1 & -3 & -3 & -1 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 3 & 4 & -12 & -12 & -4 & -1 \\
        0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -2
        \end{pmatrix}
        \cdot
        \begin{pmatrix}
        n_1 \\ n_2 \\ n_3 \\ n_4 \\ n_5 \\ n_6 \\ n_7
        \end{pmatrix}
        = \vec{0}
        \label{equ_chemi_matrix}
    \end{equation}
    
    An exact solution $\vec{n}$ can't be found using only the six equations~\eqref{equ_chemi_matrix}, but since we are looking for a solution corresponding to stoechiometric coefficients, it is necessary for this values to be all integers, and normally the smallest ones. In order to obtain the desired solution, we add a seventh equation $n_7 = n$, and then search for the smallest $n$ in order that all coefficients are integers. We then found the following solution :
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{pmatrix}
        n_1 \\ n_2 \\ n_3 \\ n_4 \\ n_5 \\ n_6 \\ n_7
        \end{pmatrix}
        =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        4 \\ 18 \\ 38 \\ 9 \\ 2 \\ 9 \\ 38
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}

    In this problem, the goal is to understand the impact of small deviations in the system’s values on the solution. In order to analyse it, we consider two systems of equation which can be rewritten as $A \vec{x_1} = \vec{b_1}$ and $A \vec{x_2} = \vec{b_2}$, with $A$ and $\vec{b_{1,2}}$ as in equation~\eqref{equ_matrix_small_deviation}.
    \begin{equation}
        A =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 1 \\
            1.001 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & -1 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        \, \,\, \, \,
        \, \,\, \, \,
        \vec{b_1} =

        \end{pmatrix}
        \, \,\, \, \,
        \, \,\, \, \,

    Using Matlab’s preexisting $cond$ function, it is possible to calculate the condition number of matrix $A$. This value measures of how much a result can change based on changes in the initial problem, i.e. the sensitivity of the system. In our case, we have $5.1998\cdot10^3$. Solving the two systems (equation~\eqref{equ_matrix_small_deviation_sol}), we see that the change of $10^{-3}$ in the right-hand side vector of the system leads to a difference of approximately $1$ in each element of the result. Consequently, a change of order of magnitude $10^3$ occurred, which is the same order of magnitude as the condition number.

    The figure~\ref{uncertainty_fig} show the dependency of the uncertainty in term of the size and the disorder of the Hamiltonian.

    On figure~\ref{figs/diff_Hamiltonian} is represented the different density probability given by an ordered and a disordered Hamiltonian. Calculating $\sigma$ for both density probability gives us $\sigma = 28.8661$ for the ordered Hamiltonian and $\sigma = 1.9853$ for the disordered one.

As one can see, cyclic methods is way faster, even through it's required more rotations. This can be explained by the fact that searching the maximum is in O(N$^2$) and a rotation (without using Matrix multiplication is in O(N).

    \begin{homeworkSection}{(1) matrix representations}
        Table~\ref{tab_matrix_size} shows how much Bytes in memory are necessary to store an N$^2\times$N$^2$ Hamiltonian matrix. Sparse matrix clearly use less Bytes, and allow us to store bigger matrix. The figure~\ref{figs/matrix_time_c} shows an other interesting thing about sparse matrix; they are way faster to compute as N increase.

        Searching for the number of bound solutions using the Hamiltonian calculated above gives us, for N$= 100, r = 5\nano\meter$ and $a=5r$, the result that there are 90 bound solutions. The three lowest are given in table~\ref{tab_probability_Ei} along with their energy and their probability to find the particle inside the quantum well. One can see that the second one is two times degenerated. The three figure~\ref{E1_fig},~\ref{E2_fig} and~\ref{E3_fig} show their wave function and probability density. As one can see, the probability obtained in table~\ref{tab_probability_Ei} can be verified on this figure.

        The figure~\ref{Eapprox1_fig} show the wave function and the probability density for energy close to 1. As one can see, the probability to find the particle inside the quantum well is very different than the one for $E_1, E_2$ or $E_3$. In fact, this probability is now $12.02\%$. The figure~\ref{figs/Eapprox1_probability_c} shows the decency of this probability in term of $a$.
