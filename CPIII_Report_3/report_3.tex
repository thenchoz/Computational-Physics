\begin{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(1) Implementation of the SD and CG methods}

    To solve a systems of linear equations, many different methods exist, such as the Steepest Descent (SD) and the Conjugate Gradient (CG) methods. These two are implemented as functions in listings~\ref{MatLab/solve_SD_clean} and~\ref{MatLab/solve_CG_clean}, where $A$ and $b$ come from the matrix form in which the system is written. One must be careful with matrix A, since it must be a symmetric positive definite matrix, otherwise the methods won't converge.

    \matlabscript{MatLab/solve_SD_clean}{A script that solves a matrix equation using the Steepest Descent method.}
    \matlabscript{MatLab/solve_CG_clean}{A script that solves a matrix equation using the Conjugate Gradient method.}
    
    The two scripts were tested, using the provided scripts $test\_solve\_SD$ and $test\_solve\_CG$, in order to make sure both algorithms were properly computed. In both cases, all tests were successful.
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(2) Comparison between the two methods}

    The goal is to now compare how effective these two methods are by studying their convergence. In a first test, a simple system of equations shown in equation~\eqref{equ_matrix_small_SDCG} is solved.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{pmatrix}
            15 &  6 &  8 &  7 & 12 \\
             6 &  9 & 11 & 10 &  7 \\
             8 & 11 & 27 & 12 &  0 \\
             7 & 10 & 12 & 15 &  8 \\
            12 &  7 &  0 &  8 & 17
        \end{pmatrix}
        \cdot \vec{x} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            5 \\
            7 \\
            4 \\
            1
        \end{pmatrix}
    \label{equ_matrix_small_SDCG}
    \end{equation}
    
    At each iteration done, the relative error was calculated and memorised for each method, which gives the convergences showed in figures~\ref{fig_conv_SDCG_small}.
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figs/error_iteration_SD_small_c.eps}
            \subcaption{SD method}
        \end{subfigure}
        \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figs/error_iteration_CG_small_c.eps}
            \subcaption{CG method}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Relative error vs Number of iterations required by both methods for solving system~\eqref{equ_matrix_small_SDCG}}
        \label{fig_conv_SDCG_small}
    \end{figure}
    
    One can clearly see that both methods converge, but it is clear that the CG method is much more efficient. This method only requires 6 iterations when it takes around 3800 iterations for the SD method to reach the precision asked. This difference can be explained by the way the two methods works. While the SD method looks at the largest gradient, the CG method always adapts to the current matrix.
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figs/error_iteration_SD_c.eps}
            \subcaption{SD method}
        \end{subfigure}
        \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figs/error_iteration_CG_c.eps}
            \subcaption{CG method}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Relative error vs Number of iterations required by both methods for solving system of size 50}
        \label{fig_conv_SDCG}
    \end{figure}
    
    In order to verify these conclusions, another convergence study is performed on a system with a $50\times50$ matrix. Results of these are shown in figures~\ref{fig_conv_SDCG}. In the case of the SD method, the number of iterations required is so large for there to be convergence that the precision ask was changed. On the contrary, the CG method is extremely fast in comparison as it only requires 103 iterations.
    
    The condition number of this second matrix is $2.88 \cdot 10^6$. In comparison, the condition number of the previous $5\times5$ matrix $A$ is of $263.7$.

\begin{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(1) The Nonlinear CG Method and Lennard-Jones potential}
    Although the CG method is fast and converge well, some problems still can't be solved with this method. In order to pass this problem, a other method is used. It is the non-linear CG method, which required to compute the gradient and the hessian matrix of the function.
    
    In this problem, the minima of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential energy is searched. This energy is given by $E(\{\vec{x_i}\})$ in equations~\eqref{equ_energy} and~\eqref{equ_energy_LJ}, representing a molecule of $N$ atoms interacting with each other. For simplicity, the constants $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ are set to 1.
    
    \begin{equation}
        E\left(\mathbf{x_1},\mathbf{x_2},\dots \mathbf{x_N}\right) = \sum_{i \neq j} U_{LJ}\left(\vert \mathbf{x_i} - \mathbf{x_j} \vert\right)
        \label{equ_energy}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        U_{LJ}(x) = 4 \epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{x}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{x}\right)^6 \right] 
        \label{equ_energy_LJ}
    \end{equation}
    
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(2) case $N = 4$}
    The figures~\ref{fig_equi_N4} show two stable solutions for the problem when $N=4$. This positions presents a final total energy of $-6.00$ for the Tetrahedral geometry, and of $-4.48$ for the Square planar geometry. This means that the second solution is a local minimum, so it can be relatively unstable.

\end{homeworkSection}



\begin{homeworkSection}{(3) case $N = 5$}
    The figures~\ref{fig_equi_N5} show two stable solutions for the problem when $N=5$. This positions presents a final total energy of $-9.10$ for the Trigonal bipyramid geometry, and of $-8.48$ for the Square pyramid geometry. This means that the second solution is a local minimum, so it can be relatively unstable. An other observation is that the energy is lower than the ones for the case $N=4$.

\end{homeworkSection}



\begin{homeworkSection}{(4) case $N = 6$}
    The figures~\ref{fig_equi_N6} show two stable solutions for the problem when $N=6$. This positions presents a final total energy of $-1.32 \cdot 10^{-4}$ for the Octahedral geometry, and of $-10.56$ for the Pentagonal pyramid geometry. This means that the first solution is a local minimum, so it can be relatively unstable.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    The singular value decomposition (SVD) method allows us to solve over-defined systems, and not only linear systems of equations. An over-defined systems means that there are more equations than unknowns variables, which means that an exact solutions can't always be found, but it will be possible to obtain the best approximation. In order to do that, one use the residual $r(x) = \vert\vert Ax - b\vert\vert$. The SVD is used to determine the solution that minimises the norm of the residual.
    
    \begin{equation}
        A \vec{x} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 2 \\
            3 & 4 \\
            5 & 6
        \end{pmatrix}
        \cdot 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            x_1 \\ x_2
        \end{pmatrix} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            1 \\
            2
        \end{pmatrix}
    \label{equ_matrix_min}
    \end{equation}

    For this exercise, the SVD of matrix $A$ was performed using the preexisting Matlab function svd in order to solve the system~\eqref{equ_matrix_min}.
    
    The basics of this method is that for a given $m \times n$ matrix ($m \ge n$), it is possible to rewrite it as the product of three matrices : $A = U \Sigma V^\dagger$ where $U$ is a unitary $m \times m$ matrix with left-singular vectors, $\Sigma$ is a diagonal $m \times n$ matrix made of the singular values, and $V$ is a unitary $n \times n$ matrix with right-singular vectors.
    
    This decomposition allows us to determine the solution that minimises the residual by defining $\Sigma^+$ as the pseudo-inverse of $\Sigma$, and then using $\vec{x} = A^+ \vec{b}$ with $A^+ = V \Sigma^+U^\dagger$ to find the solution. The solution $\vec{x}$ for the problem above is given by equation~\eqref{equ_solu_x}.

    \begin{equation}
        \vec{x} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            -0.33 \\ 0.58
        \end{pmatrix}
        \label{equ_solu_x}
    \end{equation}

    It is possible to verify graphically that we have found the proper solution by simply plotting the magnitude of the residual. This is illustrated in figure~\ref{figs/vicinity_least_energy_c}.

    From the result obtained in equation~\eqref{equ_matrix_result_sigma}, one can deduce that it's the matrix $C^2$ which represent a pure state and $C^1$ is therefor entangled. Equations~\eqref{equ_matrix_result_psi} show the two vector $\psi^A$ and $\psi^B$ that form the pure state.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \psi^A =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            -0.5177 \\
            -0.1980 \\
            -0.6645 \\
            -0.2256 \\
            -0.4476 
        \end{pmatrix},
        \qquad \qquad
        \psi^B =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            -0.4396 \\ -0.8465 \\ -0.3002
        \end{pmatrix}
        \label{equ_matrix_result_psi}
    \end{equation}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Hubble’s law states that astrophysical objects that are sufficiently far from one another (e.g. two galaxies) move away from each other at a relative speed proportional to their distance:
    
    \begin{equation}
        v = H d
    \end{equation}
    where $v$ is the relative speed, $d$ is the distance separating them and $H$ is the Hubble’s constant. Performing a linear fit on the given data using SVD (which can be seen with the data on figure~\ref{figs/fit_Hubble_c}) give us an estimate of Hubble’s constant: $H = 423.94$~[km$\cdot$s$^{-1}\cdot$Mpc$^{-1}$].
